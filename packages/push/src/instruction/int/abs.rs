/// An instruction that takes the absolute value of the top
/// value on the `i64` stack.
///
/// There's an edge case when the value is `i64::MIN` since
/// negating that generates a wrapping error. This is because the two's
/// complement representation used for integer types has an asymmetry
/// where the magnitude of `MIN` is one larger than the magnitude of `MAX`.
/// See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement#Most_negative_number>
/// for additional details and examples.
///
/// In our implementation, `Abs` returns `i64::MAX` when taking the absolute
/// value of
/// `i64::MIN`. This isn't mathematically accurate, but is semantically
/// plausible since it converts the smallest negative number into the largest
/// positive number.
///
/// The alternative would be to have this instruction "fail"
/// in some way on `i64::MIN`, presumably by either skipping the instruction or
/// generating a fatal error and terminating program evaluation. Neither of
/// these options seem terribly reasonable from an evolutionary standpoint.
/// Skipping would leave the value on the stack, un-negated, which would
/// be quite "surprising" and almost certainly lead to unexpected behavior.
/// Failing doesn't seem to be in the spirit of Push, where we try to make
/// sure almost every instruction "succeeds" in some reasonable way.
///
/// # Inputs
///
/// The `IntInstruction::Abs` instruction takes the following inputs:
///    - `i64` stack
///      - One value
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// The `IntInstruction::Abs` instruction takes the absolute value of the top
/// value of the `i64` stack. The one exception (as described above) is when
/// the value is `i64::MIN`, where `Abs` removes it and pushes
/// on `i64::MAX` in its place.
///
/// ## Action Table
///
/// The table below indicates the behavior in each of the different
/// cases.
///
///    - The "`i64` stack" column indicates the value of the top of the `i64`
///      stack, or whether it exists.
///    - The "Success" column indicates whether the instruction succeeds, and if
///      not what kind of error is returned:
///       - ✅: success
///       - ❗: recoverable error, with links to the error kind
///       - ‼️: fatal error, with links to the error kind
///    - The "Note" column briefly summarizes the action state in that case
///
/// | `i64` stack  |  Success | Note |
/// | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
/// | `i64::MIN`    | ✅ | `i64::MIN` is replaced with `i64::MAX` |
/// | exists, not `i64::MIN` | ✅ | Takes the absolute value of the top value of the `i64` stack |
/// | missing | [❗..](crate::push_vm::stack::StackError::Underflow) | State is unchanged |
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns a
/// [`StackError::Underflow`](crate::push_vm::stack::StackError::Underflow)
/// error when the `i64` stack is empty.
///
/// # Differences
/// Implementations of integer negation instructions in Clojure (e.g., Clojush
/// or Propeller) or Python (e.g. `PyshGP`) won't have the wrapping issue
/// because they act on arbitrary precision integers.
