/// See [`FnScorer`] for a wrapper which can convert any function to a scorer.
///
/// Note that similarly to the `Read` and `Write` traits in the
/// standard library, the [`Scorer`] trait is implemented for references to
/// scorers. That means, if you don't wish to consume a scorer and want to
/// re-use it later, you can pass a reference to that scorer to any function
/// expecting a [`Scorer`] instead.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # use ec_core::individual::scorer::{Scorer, FnScorer};
/// let scorer_function = |x: &i32| x.abs_diff(10);
/// // FnScorer implements Scorer.
/// let scorer = FnScorer(scorer_function);
///
/// let score = scorer.score(&8);
///
/// assert_eq!(score, 2);
/// ```
///
/// ```
/// # use ec_core::individual::scorer::Scorer;
/// pub struct TenScorer;
///
/// impl Scorer<i32> for TenScorer {
///     type Score = u32;
///
///     fn score(&self, genome: &i32) -> Self::Score {
///         genome.abs_diff(10)
///     }
/// }
///
/// let score = TenScorer.score(&8);
/// assert_eq!(score, 2);
/// ```
