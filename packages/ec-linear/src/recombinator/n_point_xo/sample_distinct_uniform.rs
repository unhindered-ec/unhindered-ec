            length - N:
                we know due to the assertion above that length >= N and as such length - N >= 0 \
                  and won't underflow.

            i + start:
                Since `i` is in the range `((length - N)..length)`, we know `i < length`.
                  Then we can bound `i+start` by:
                    i + start < length + start
                              = (end - start) + start
                              = end
                  so `i + start < end`. Thus `i + start` can't overflow because `end` is a legal \
                  value of type `usize`.

            pos + 1:
                Since we iterate over (length - N)..length which is of size N we know that the loop
                will have exactly N iterations (to fill the entire array).

                Throughout the `for` loop we know:
                  - `filled < N`
                  - `pos<=filled` because it is in the range `0..=filled`,

                Then the `copy_within` call is passed `pos..filled` as the source range and
                  `pos + 1` as the start of the destination range; thus the destination range
                  is `(pos + 1)..(filled + 1)`. All four range ends are at most `N` because
                  (as shown above) `pos <= filled < N`.

                We also know that `pos <= filled < N`, so `pos + 1 <= N`, so it can't overflow
                since both `N` and `pos` are of type `usize`.
