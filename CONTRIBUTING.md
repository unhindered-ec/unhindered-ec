# IDE setup
We are currently using unstable rustfmt features in our rustfmt.toml, which isn't supported through rustfmt stable natively, as rustfmt v1 stable only supports unstable options via the command line. As such we are currently using a small wrapper around rustfmt, called `rustfmt-unstable`, which essentially passes the arguments in the config file via the cli.

To be consistent in ci & in our local development experience, we also overwrote the rustfmt command for rust-analyzer in both vscode and helix.
If you are using one of these editors you will need to install rustfmt-unstable via `cargo install rustfmt-unstable` to get formatting working.

## Publishing to a registry
When publishing this workspace to a registry we have to consider that we have intra-workspace dependencies.
As such sadly publishing a new version isn't _quite_ as easy as bumping one version number and running cargo publish.

The following steps are usually required:
1. Bump the main version number in the root `Cargo.toml` (the `version = "..."` key at the top of the file). Make sure to maintain semver guarantees while doing that.
2. Update the intra workspace dependencies. Since we use workspace dependencies for all of them, this is self-contained in the `Cargo.toml` file at the workspace root:
    1. Go down to the `[workspace.dependencies]` section. There you'll find the workspace packages as workspace dependencies using `path = "..."` style references.
    2. Bump the version of all the workspace packages to the same version you have choosen in step 1. If they don't have a `version = "..."` key already, feel free to add them in **addition** to the `path = "..."` key. That will ensure that we still use path dependencies while developing locally and only use the version when publishing (cargo supports that).
    3. If you are publishing to a registry other than your system's default one (which is usually `crates.io`) you'll also need to add a `registry = "..."` key along the version key from the step above. Make sure to not push this (commit it only locally to satisfy cargo), as the  CI won't find your locally configured registry and as such will fail to build.
3. Now we can finally use `cargo publish --workspace` to publish the workspace packages. Make sure that you include the `--registry` argument if you plan to publish to another registry than your systems default one.
